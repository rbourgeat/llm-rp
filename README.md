✨ Your Custom Offline Role Play with AI on Mac and Linux (for now) 🧙‍♂️
</p>

![LLM RP](llm-rp.png)

## 📎 Requirement

For now, Mac & Linux:
- Python >= 3.8
- `pip install -r requirements.txt && python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
- Install `git lfs`

## 🛠️ Config

You can custom global variables at the top of `app/run.py` as you want.

For increase performance, you can reduce the generated images size,
the number of iterations etc...

🖍️ Note: the output images folder is in `app/images/`

## 👉🏻 Start

Each time you want to run the game:

```bash
python3 app/run.py
```

The first time you load the app you will wait a while,
because the program will download, export and quantize 
the better llama model for your config and install stable diffusion.

Next open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:4242
